        <p>Prof. Scientist worked in a university which was rich in resources and as he was rich in ambition, this suited him perfectly. He usually spent many hours in his office amidst books and, begrudgingly, on his laptop - hours filled with work that sometimes made his head spin and sometimes filled his heart with immeasureable love for the universe.</p>
        <h1><a href="scientist4.html">And while he was happy with his work, of course not all of his days were joyful and fulfilling.</a></h1>
