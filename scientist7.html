        <p>Prof. Scientist knew he’d gotten himself into an unsolvable conundrum. Or, to be precise, he knew the conundrum was extremely difficult to solve. Maybe it would be unsolvable to him, in the end. However, Prof. Scientist was not a man known for giving up easily. Not in chemistry class in eighth grade, never in handball (though perhaps there would have been no shame in giving up there after even his best try proved subpar at best). And he felt he especially shouldn’t give up in his academic work.
          Should Prof. Scientist give up and consider simpler mysteries?</p>
