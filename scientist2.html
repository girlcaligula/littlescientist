        <p>There lived once, and indeed lives still, a professor of physics. He was in some ways no different than his colleagues - like most university professors his goal was to teach his students to the best of his ability; like most  physicists this professor wished deeply to expand the world's collective understanding of the universe. Often he wondered - would he ever succeed? </p>
