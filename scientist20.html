        <p>Prof. Scientist will not be booking a ticket. His research has led him to many heights and pitfalls and while his flirting with quantum physics is proving unrequited so far, his love is true and not contingent on reciprocation. Prof. Scientist will continue to inspire students and contribute to the wider understanding of physics and maybe one day, when he doesn’t really expect it, when he’s just reading a paper on quantum decoherence for fun, an idea will strike him. And then he’ll have to call Prof. Vector again. And then maybe who knows. The possibilities, as always, are endless.</p>
