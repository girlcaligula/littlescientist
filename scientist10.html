        <p>On one such walk, passing by an open door he knew too well, he heard a loud thud. It was the door leading to the office of his good friend, Prof. Dr. Vector, one of the most renowned mathematicians in the country. Prof. Scientist liked him however not for his scientific prowess, but for his equally enviable tennis skills and because despite them, he was still good enough to beat him in most matches they'd played.</p>
