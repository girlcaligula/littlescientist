        <p>Prof. Scientist is not booking a ticket yet. But he will be. And he will be so frazzled and lightheaded by his achievement for so many months that he will book the ticket in the very last moment. It will cost an exorbitant amount of money and Prof. Scientist’s wallet will still be feeling it for a long time after. It won’t matter that the Nobel Prize money covers the ticket a thousand times over. He wasn’t raised to be wasteful. However he was raised to explore the universe, and he will have, and he will remember the ticket expense conundrum for the rest of his life fondly, with a smile.</p>
