        <p>Youâ€™ll ask, rightfully, what happened afterwards. Did Prof. Scientist come closer to understanding quantum entanglement? The truth is, his research is still continuing to this day. As anybody in academia will tell you, these things take time. Last time I saw him he was giving a lecture on advanced theoretical physics to which he was fifteen minutes left though instead of apologetic, he looked exalted the entire way through. This was several years after he started working with Prof. Vector. The lecture was brilliant, as usual. I look him up on the internet now and again and wonder what he is doing.</p>
