        <p>At first, Prof. Scientist was skeptical. Then he couldn’t help becoming interested. After a few more cups of coffee and at least three mathematical disputes that were teetering on inflammatory before Prof. Scientist and Prof. Vector had gotten themselves together and remembered they were not only scientists, but also friends, a conclusion was reached. Prof. Scientist had missed a couple of things. Specifically he had missed a perspective entirely – the purely mathematical perspective. He would never admit it, certainly not to Prof. Vector, maybe there was something about a mathematician’s particular grasp on math that physicists could have been utilizing much more efficiently than they were. Prof. Scientist was so excited, he could almost see himself booking tickets to Stockholm some years in the future to receive his Nobel Prize.</p>
